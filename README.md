# Integrated Project Two

To make your life easier working on github and git I recommend you use [Git Kraken]([https://www.gitkraken.com/)
## Steps To Begin working on the project
- Fork this project
- Clone your fork onto your PC. 
- Open it with your IDE.
- Open the project with GitKraken
    - Create a branch from `master` if you want to use good version control practices but work on master if you don't want to get confused by git.
- Pick one feature and work on it: let us know by updating the issue page on the original repository (https://github.com/ebenezergraham/integrated-project-two/issues).

### Make pull request to add your work to the `submission` branch
- Make sure your branch is up to date with the submission branch by pulling. Use Git Kraken to avoid problems
- Merge your work and then make a push onto your Fork
- Make a pull request on the original repo  

## TIPS
Please do not edit the bootstrap css. I linked and min version just to make sure. create a class in the `sytle.css`
